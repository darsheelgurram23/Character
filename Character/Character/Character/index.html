        Aladeen the Dictator
    </h1>
    <body>
    <div class = "text">Aladeen is a fictional dictator from the 2012 film The Dictator, portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen. Ruling the fictional country of Wadiya, he is arrogant, cruel, and outlandish, mocking real-life authoritarian leaders. The film follows his journey to the U.S. to prevent a democratic constitution that would strip him of power. Aladeenâ€™s antics and ignorance provide satirical commentary on dictatorship through crude humor.</div>
